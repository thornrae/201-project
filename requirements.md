### Vision

The vision of this web application is to create a game environment that mimicks Family Feud, one of the greatest and longest airing game shows on television.  This project will provide users with an activity whether they need a procrastination break or a pause from the news cycle.  Games make people happy, and that is our goal with this web application.

### Scope 
- This web app will request and store player names
- This web app will randomly generate a survey question
- If correct survey answer is submitted, this web app will display the answer to the player
- This web app will store and display score results
- This web app will tell you more about its developers
- This app will not allow for communication or between two computers

### MVP
- Store player points and render to results page
- Generate random survey question
- Length of game sessions will be determined by the countdown of the timer
- Users play to see how many points they can get before the timer runs out and session is over
- Game session ends when one of two things occur: the timer runs out, or, the user submits three wrong survey answers

### STRETCH GOALS
- Adding the functionality of being able to create a "team" and play with more than one user (on the same computer - handoff)
- Creating easy, medium and hard levels

### Functional Requirements
1. Users can create and play under their own player name
1. Users can submit survey answers to survey question
1. Users can see previous score results
