## Survey Says!

Members: Dawit, Matthew, Thomas and Taylor

Summary: We want to create a Code Fellows version of Family Feud called: "Survey Says!". The user will be prompted to list a playername to start the game (this will help us track score results and load local storage).  The user will be presented with a randomly generated question and asked to list the top answers to the question.  The DOM would render the question and the appropriate number of blanks for the top answers. The user will have a certain amount of time to submit a response and will be given three chances to complete the board. If the user guesses all five answers, they will go on to the next round and their scores will be compounded. If the user does not guess all give answers, they will have the option to play again.

Project Management Tool: Jira

Langauges Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
